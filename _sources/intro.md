# User Survey Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook encapsulates analyses of data collected through the Canadiana user survey posted to canadiana.ca in November 2023.

The notebook utilizes Python and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and generate informative visualizations. We took advantage of an AI system, deepnote.com, to aid our analysis. 

Check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.

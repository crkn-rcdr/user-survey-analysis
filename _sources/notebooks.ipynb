NaN values have been replaced with empty strings and all text has been transformed into lowercase. \n\nThe next step is to transform the text data in the 'Other Identification' column into a format that can be used for analysis. For this, we will use the TF-IDF Vectorizer from the sklearn library. This vectorizer transforms the text data into a matrix of TF-IDF features.\n\nTF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. It is a numerical statistic intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus.\n\nLet's proceed with vectorization.","block_group":"2fb8d78945f6450ca6056871af48be63"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"492ada4","execution_start":1702046197284,"execution_millis":7,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"cell_id":"14b729a6527b483a82b5f0127e8bcfc4","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"# Vectorize the 'Other Identification' text data using TF-IDF Vectorizer\r\ntfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\r\ntfidf_matrix = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(df['Other Identification'])\r\n\r\n# Check the shape of the TF-IDF matrix\r\ntfidf_matrix.shape","block_group":"f2da481895ed4362984a143e269c6b2e","execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":14,"data":{"text/plain":"(1005, 147)"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"982acbc3149947a7a9c487fa2454b02d","deepnote_cell_type":"text-cell-p"},"source":"The TF-IDF vectorization of the 'Other Identification' column was successful.

To decide the number of clusters, we will start with a reasonable number like five. Afterward, we can adjust this number based on the output and requirements.

The cluster assignments provide us a way to group similar 'Other Identification' entries together. \n\nThe next step would be to name these clusters meaningfully. We'll use the common words (features) in each cluster to name them. For example, if the top terms in a cluster are ['organized', 'professional', 'business'], then we might name that cluster 'Professional Business'. Naming the clusters would allow us to replace the 'Other Identification' column in a more interpretable way.\n\nLet's identify these top terms for each cluster and then name the clusters accordingly. To do this, we'll list the top N words close to the centroid of each cluster in the multi-dimensional TF-IDF space. The centroid of a cluster in this context essentially represents the \"averaged theme\" of all the text entries falling into that cluster.\n\nLet's proceed with this step.","block_group":"18e0d71924a6483c990774c2045caf9d"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"c793d4b3","execution_start":1702046250304,"execution_millis":8,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"cell_id":"9c2d9cefc6dc4070b9cccec77b86f81c","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"# Identify top N words in each cluster\r\nN = 3\r\norder_centroids = km.cluster_centers_.argsort()[:, ::-1]\r\nterms = tfidf_vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()\r\n\r\nfor i in range(num_clusters):\r\n    print(\"Cluster %d:\" % i, end='')\r\n    for ind in order_centroids[i, :N]:\r\n        print(' %s' % terms[ind], end='')\r\n    print()","block_group":"0bb8e4eebd694b12a22cc819c1d969a6","execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Cluster 0: writer retired professor\nCluster 1: researcher historical society\nCluster 2: historian amateur local\nCluster 3: editor and historian\nCluster 4: independent researcher scholar\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"e12166c6d4ce4e16a68baf1e5a089727","deepnote_cell_type":"text-cell-p"},"source":"We have successfully identified the top 3 terms in each cluster.

column has been successfully replaced with the columns representing the cluster names. Each row now has a 1 in the column of the cluster it is a part of, and 0 in the rest. This means, for example, if 'Writer, Retired, Professor' is 1, then it implies that 'Other Identification' of that particular entry was found to be most closely associated with the cluster represented by the terms [writer, retired, professor].\n\nIn summary:\n\n1. I loaded the 'cleaned.csv' dataset and preprocessed the 'Other Identification' column.\n2. I vectorized the column's text data using a TF-IDF Vectorizer.\n3. I ran a KMeans clustering algorithm to group similar entries based on the TF-IDF matrix.\n4. Each resulting cluster was then named based on the top three cluster's terms.\n5. Finally, the 'Other Identification' column was replaced with binary columns for each cluster, thus accomplishing your goal.\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything more you need or if you want to make some changes.","block_group":"f3e3f1b7aa244a1c83eaa1cd48d8e11c"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"663428dee7bd4586b07b3276cd51d1bf","deepnote_cell_type":"text-cell-callout"},"source":"> Do the same as the previous step but for the Other Interest column","block_group":"2094400ba55d4c1d91de21927fb1bd37"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"de64d23","execution_start":1702046356626,"execution_millis":142,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"cell_id":"5f8e5e240b3f470f9718d2737ee88573","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"# Importing necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n\n# Load the data\ndf = pd.read_csv('cleaned.csv')\n\n# Preprocessing\ndf['Other Interest'].fillna('', inplace=True)\ndf['Other Interest'] = df['Other Interest'].apply(lambda x: x.lower())\n\n# Vectorize the 'Other Interest' text data using TF-IDF Vectorizer\ntfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\ntfidf_matrix = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(df['Other Interest'])\n\n# Specify number of clusters\nnum_clusters = 5\n\n# Perform KMeans clustering\nkm = KMeans(n_clusters=5)\n\n# Fit the KMeans model onto this vectorized data\nkm.fit(tfidf_matrix)\n\n# Get the cluster assignments for each data point\nclusters = km.labels_.tolist()\n\n# Identify top N words in each cluster\nN = 3\norder_centroids = km.cluster_centers_.argsort()[:, ::-1]\nterms = tfidf_vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()\n\ntop_terms = {}\nfor i in range(num_clusters):\n    top_terms[i] = [terms[ind] for ind in order_centroids[i, :N]]\n\ntop_terms","block_group":"0fb2e7d7425a4c6b9491eebc5d0cd793","execution_count":18,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":18,"data":{"text/plain":"{0: ['anthropology', 'studies', 'archaeology'],\n 1: ['history', 'local', 'railway'],\n 2: ['theology', 'biblical', 'psychotherapy'],\n 3: ['architecture', 'youth', 'garden'],\n 4: ['religion', 'youth', 'equality']}"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"be62c5cf3132405d87d64a9b5255e654","deepnote_cell_type":"text-cell-p"},"source":"I have successfully performed preprocessing, vectorization, clustering, and naming of clusters for the 'Other Interest' column.

been removed successfully and replaced with five new columns representing the cluster categories identified previously. Each row is now marked with a 1 if it belongs to that cluster and 0 otherwise.\n\nTo summarize, I carried out the following steps:\n1. Loaded the dataset and filled missing values in the 'Other Interest' column.\n2. Preprocessed this column by transforming all text to lowercase.\n3. Converted the text data into a TF-IDF matrix using TfidfVectorizer.\n4. Performed a KMeans clustering with 5 clusters on this matrix.\n5. Identified the top three terms per cluster to name each one:\n    - Cluster 0: 'Anthropology, Studies, Archaeology'\n    - Cluster 1: 'History, Local, Railway'\n    - Cluster 2: 'Theology, Biblical, Psychotherapy'\n    - Cluster 3: 'Architecture, Youth, Garden'\n    - Cluster 4: 'Religion, Youth, Equality'\n6. Finally, replaced the original 'Other Interest' column in the dataframe with a column for each cluster category. The column for the cluster a row belongs to is marked as 1, and all others are marked as 0.\n\nThese newly created columns present a much more clear sense of what the original 'Other Interest' content implied in terms of certain broad categories defined by the clusters. Feel free to ask if you need more information or further analyses.","block_group":"05c0bc115c834d4db9fc5dd6b501a70e"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a style='text-decoration:none;line-height:16px;display:flex;color:#5B5B62;padding:10px;justify-content:end;' href='https://deepnote.com?utm_source=created-in-deepnote-cell&projectId=78bfc222-b866-4a43-b8a8-c2a8d5467ce5' target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt='Created in deepnote.com' style='display:inline;max-height:16px;margin:0px;margin-right:7.5px;' src='data:image/svg+xml;base64,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' > </img>\nCreated in <span style='font-weight:600;margin-left:4px;'>Deepnote</span></a>","metadata":{"created_in_deepnote_cell":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0,"metadata":{"deepnote":{},"orig_nbformat":2,"deepnote_notebook_id":"a5a1241b2ede4e09957644f252a68bb8","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
